It has a trading area population of 341,180, including parts of British Columbia, and provides jobs for up to 86,000 people who commute to and within the city. Lethbridge's economy has traditionally been agriculture-based; however, it has diversified in recent years. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. Lethbridge serves as a hub for commercial activity in the region by providing services and amenities. Many transport services, including four provincal highways, rail service and an airport, are concentrated in or near the city."</p>
